In this code, I'm querying a database that contains multiple tables in it, to quantify statistics about customers and order data for different months.


--- 1. How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;


--- 2. How many of the orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE Product LIKE "iPhone";


---- 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT FebSales.orderID, customers.acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT OUTER JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID;


---- 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price asc 
LIMIT 1;

---- 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 

SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price as total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;


---- 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price, location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE "548 Lincoln%Seattle%"
GROUP BY product;


---- 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT count(DISTINCT customers.acctnum) as Customers_With_Multiple_Orders, 
  avg(febsales.quantity*febsales.price) as Avg_Spent
FROM BIT_DB.customers
LEFT OUTER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = febsales.orderID
WHERE FebSales.Quantity >2;


---- 8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;



---- 9. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?

SELECT location, COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID) > 2;


---- 10. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT product, sum(quantity) as quantity
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product LIKE '%headphone%'
GROUP BY product;


---- 11. What was the average amount spent per account in February? 

SELECT (sum(febsales.quantity*febsales.price))/(COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum))
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id;


---- 12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? 

SELECT (sum(febsales.quantity))/(COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum)) as avg_products_per_acct
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id;


---- 13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT product, sum(quantity*price) as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY revenue DESC LIMIT 1;
