SELECT title, date_added
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE date_added is not null
ORDER BY date_added desc
limit 20 
;


--List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.

SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc;


--Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?

SELECT netflix_titles_info.title, netflix_people.director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people"
ON netflix_people.show_id = netflix_titles_info.show_id
WHERE netflix_titles_info.title = 'Bright Star';
